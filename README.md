# Typst Template DHBW <a href="https://github.tools.sap/I550629/vt-template-typst/generate"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Generate_from_Template-8A2BE2?logo=github" /></a>

This is a university report template written in [Typst](https://typst.app/), 
based on the [vtgermany/LaTeX-Template-DHBW](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/vtgermany/LaTeX-Template-DHBW).

> Typst was born out of our frustration with LaTeX. Not knowing what we were in for, we decided to take matters into our own hands and started building. -Typst 

Typst is a replacement for LaTeX which was designed to be **as powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use**.
It has a much simpler syntax (similar to Markdown), _actual good error messages_ (looking at you, LaTeX) 
and out-of-the-box bibliography features using `.bib` or `.yaml` files (see `example.yaml`) (again, looking at you, LaTeX).

If you want to explore other features here is the link for the offical [documentation](https://typst.app/docs/).

## ✨ Features

Here are some basic features our template provides:

### Pre-defined Pages

The template supports the following pages out-of-the-box:

- Title Page
- Declaration of Originality
- Confidential Clause
- Abstracts (in multiple languages)
- Table of Contents
- List of Abbreviations
- List of Figures
- List of Tables
- Source Code Directory
- Bibliography

The Confidential Clause can be toggled by setting `confidential_clause` and the abstracts can be modified by changing the `abstract` field:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>main.typ</code> @ <code>#show: project.with(</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><pre lang="yaml">confidential_clause: true
abstract: (
  ("de", "Deutsch", 
    include("abstracts/abstract_german.typ")
  ),
  ("en", "English", 
    [*Hello World!* This is my abstract.]
  )
),</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> **Note**: Some outlines are only shown if your document contains figures which should be outlined. 
> For example, `List of Figures` will be hidden if you dont't have any images in your document.

---

### Languages

You can switch to a different language easily by setting `lang` in your main document. This will also affect some region-based writing style.
If the language is set to "de", quotes will be `„test"`, otherwise `"test"`.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>main.typ</code> @ <code>#show: project.with(</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><pre lang="yaml">lang: "de"</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Currently, there are 2 languages supported:

|Language|Code|
|---|---|
|German|`de`|
|English|`en`|

---

### Abbreviations

First, define the acronyms in the `acronyms` field then initialize the template, with the keys being the acronyms and the values being arrays of their definitions. If there is only a singular version of the definition, the array contains only one value (don't forget the trailing comma to force typst to consider it as an array). If there are both singular and plural versions, define the definition as an array where the first item is the singular definition and the second item is the plural.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>main.typ</code> @ <code>#show: project.with(</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><pre lang="yaml">acronyms: (
  "OS": ("Operating System",),
  "BIOS": ("Basic Input/Output System", "Basic Input/Output Systems"), 
)</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Once the acronyms are defined, you can use them in the text with the `#acr(...)` function. To get the plural version of the acronym, you can use the `#acrpl(...)` function that adds an 's' after the acronym. If a plural version of the definition is provided, it will be used if the first use of the acronym is plural. Otherwise, the singular version is used, and a trailing 's' is added.

> **Note**: you need to import the `acrostiche` package in every file you want to use acronyms:
>
> ```typ
> #import "@preview/acrostiche:0.2.0": acr, acrpl
> ```

## 🛠️ Setup

Here are some basic setup instructions, if you need more details please refer to the [documentation](https://typst.app/docs/).

### Local Compiler

Please note that common editors like VS Code provide only limited support for Typst.
Mostly auto-complete and syntax highlighting is only provided in a _relatively_ basic form.
For VS Code, you can install the [`Typst LSP` Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nvarner.typst-lsp).

1. Click on [![Generate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Generate-8A2BE2?logo=github)](https://github.tools.sap/I550629/vt-template-typst/generate) and name the repository (e. g. `pa-1`)
2. Clone the created repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.tools.sap/I550629/pa-1.git`
3. Navigate to the repository `cd pa-1`
4. Install [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)
    - Pre-compiled Binaries: [typst/releases](https://github.com/typst/typst/releases/)
    - macOS/Linux: `brew install typst`
    - Arch Linux: `pacman -S typst`
    - Void Linux: `xbps-install typst`
7. Compile your PDF: `typst compile main.typ`
8. Open the PDF in your favorite PDF-Viewer

If you want live updates, you can use `typst watch main.typ` for automatically watch for changes in your code.

---

### Web-IDE

Please note that the Web-IDE **does not** have the ability to upload your work to a VCS like GitHub.
But it supports better auto-complete and a nicer user experience.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Please make sure **you are allowed to work in a cloud environment** if working with confidential information.
> A good rule-of-thumb would be to not use the Web-IDE if your document contains a [Confidential Clause](#content) 😊.

1. Clone the Template to your local machine: `git clone https://github.tools.sap/I550629/vt-template-typst.git`
2. Open the [Web-IDE](https://typst.app/)
3. Start a new project
4. Manually copy all files from the template to the new project
